        <h1>A-Frame Portfolio Piece: Project Proposal</h1>
        
        <h4>Jamie Zeigler</h4>
        
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> I want to show my skills with VR and web design as part of my portfolio. I want my portfolio and my work to show future employers who I am and the type of content I want to be involved with. I want to work with social service organizations, nonprofits, and governance in local communities.</p>  

        <p>I want to use A-frame to show more of data visualization and infographics. I'm deciding between making a scene as my opening page for my portfolio or as a subpage on my “projects” page. I want to explore the complexity of the work and will decide on the minor details once I learn how to implement an Aframe scene. </p>

        <p><strong>Goals:</strong> My goal is to showcase myself and my work to future employers or clients. I want the portfolio to represent myself so it attracts the right organizations. I want to work with companies that are in line with my values and beliefs so having a portfolio that represents that is important. </p>

        <p><strong>Audience:</strong> Potential employers or clients.
         I want to work with companies or nonprofit agencies to help get their message or mission out to the world. I want to use the skills I have learned in SMAD to help give these organizations the platform they need to speak their truth. I want the portfolio to reflect my true self in hope to find a career or a path that aligns with my goals and values.</p> 
        <p>In Technically Wrong, there were a few points brought up in the persona chapter that I believe should be implemented while creating my personas. Wachter-Boettcher said, “...personas encouraged the team to assume that demographic information drove motivations…” She was talking about how we generalize and stereotype our personas by assigning them gender, race and photos. These aspects are not necessary to understand the motivations of the audience.</p>
